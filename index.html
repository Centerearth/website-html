        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi! I'm a freshman studying computer science at Brigahm Young University Provo campus. I love it here! I like to play piano, make and eat good food, and hang out with friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          One day I hope to work in cybersecurity and potentially get a Phd. Still deciding obviously.

        <p>
          Gone is the stress you feel every time that you pick classes out for your next semester at BYU. RateMyClass is a RateMyProfessor spinoff that makes the process of choosing easy by giving you all the information you need to make informed decisions. Students who have taken a certain class can post reviews about the difficulty level of the class, professor and TA recommendations, helpful resources, things to watch out for, and really anything else. Students looking to take the class can find the class among a list of all current BYU classes and review the posts made by previous takers to make their BYU stay as smooth as possible.
